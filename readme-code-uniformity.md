#####File names
Filename should be in lowercase with "_" to separate words in the name and "-" to separate type of the file (service, controller etc.).
Eg. user-service.ts, user_role-service.ts, user_login_logout-service.ts

#####Code Formatting
1. Indentation: 4 spaces (some people might disagree, but we have to fix something)
2. EOL: LF (default for git)

#####Naming Conventions
1. private variables - prefixed with "\_", camelCase
2. public/static variables - camelCase
3. constants - ALL\_CAPS 
4. methods - camelCase
5. classes - PascalCase
6. enums - name PascalCase, fields ALL\_CAPS
